64,What was the developer experience like in the old days?,"I've been curious about this for a long time as to how did the people during the old days finish writing software that went on to reshape the world. 
I mean, nowadays we have an lsp that is there to correct us and give us syntax cause who wants to go through the pain of remembering keywords right?
If you're from the webdev world then you have frameworks with hot module replacement or reloading so that we don't have to go through the process of compiling things or the minor inconvenience of saving our files and restarting our dev servers, something that the new generation of devs seem to have no gratitude for at all. This speed with which we can produce software seems to make us too lazy I guess, we don't seem to be that concerned with getting it right the first time and we adopt that attitude of, ""I'll eventually fix it."", which often leads to horrendous software experiences. 
Then there is AI, which kind of takes away the need to really and I mean really learn what we are doing. Just the understanding of how the boilerplate works is something that can only be achieved if we try to write it down and reason about it. But that is gone, ai can just generate that and the people with no experience are expected to write the parts in the middle that connects everything and the problem is that they don't even have the fundamentals down to be able to do that. 
Basically, developer experience nowadays is getting automated to a level where we'll probably stop having good new programmers.

And that really makes me appreciate the generation that was stuck on a few kilobytes of ram with just a plain text editor making things for the future. I don't even get why we are so ungrateful and unwilling to learn the fundamentals. Where is the humility? Do you really think that the code that an ai wrote that you just copied over proves thay you have any sort of intelligence? Be humble and keep learning.",196,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTjH-QrXfzGwURF2uSv8GBFkY0LaIv2Ktvfew&usqp=CAU
